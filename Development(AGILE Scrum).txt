Development

The researchers utilized the Agile Scrum methodology as the software development approach in creating the Real-Time Flood Monitoring System with Water Level Forecasting Using LoRaWAN-Based Wireless Sensor Network. Agile Scrum was selected because it provides an iterative and incremental framework that allows the team to continuously develop, test, and improve the system through short, structured work cycles known as sprints. This methodology emphasizes adaptability, teamwork, and early delivery of functional components, making it suitable for projects that involve both hardware and software integration, such as IoT-based systems.

Agile Scrum is characterized by its key elements, including defined roles, process artifacts, and recurring activities. The main roles in this methodology consist of the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. The Product Owner, represented by the group leader, is responsible for defining the system requirements, prioritizing the tasks to be developed, and ensuring that the project outcomes align with user requirements and the community’s flood management needs. The Scrum Master, another designated team member, facilitates sprint planning, monitors progress, and ensures that Agile principles are properly applied throughout the development process. The Development Team, composed of all members, is tasked with designing, coding, testing, and integrating both hardware and software components of the system. The project adviser serves as an external stakeholder who provides technical guidance, academic supervision, and feedback during sprint reviews to ensure that the project adheres to institutional standards and real-world applicability.

The primary artifacts in the Agile Scrum framework include the Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment. The Product Backlog serves as a prioritized list of all system requirements, such as sensor node integration, data transmission, forecasting algorithms, and user dashboards. The Sprint Backlog consists of selected tasks from the Product Backlog that are targeted for completion during a specific sprint. The Increment refers to the working version of the system delivered at the end of each sprint. Furthermore, Scrum practices include several recurring activities: Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective. Sprint Planning defines the objectives and tasks to be achieved during each sprint. Daily Stand-ups are short, daily meetings that allow the team to share progress, identify issues, and plan their work for the day. The Sprint Review occurs at the end of each sprint to present the completed outputs to the adviser and gather feedback. Lastly, the Sprint Retrospective enables the team to reflect on their performance, identify challenges encountered, and plan for process improvements in the next sprint.

The adoption of the Agile Scrum methodology is justified by the dynamic and modular nature of the project. The Real-Time Flood Monitoring System involves multiple interconnected components that can be developed and tested independently, such as sensor calibration, data transmission, machine learning forecasting, and user interface development. The iterative process of Scrum allows the researchers to continuously refine and enhance each system module based on testing results and user feedback. This approach ensures that technical issues are addressed early, system performance is optimized, and the final product meets both functional and non-functional requirements. Furthermore, Agile Scrum promotes collaboration among team members, allowing hardware and software tasks to progress concurrently without compromising system coherence.

The development of the proposed system was divided into five major sprints, each lasting approximately two to three weeks. The output of each sprint served as a functional component that contributed to the system’s overall completion. Sprint 1 focused on project planning and system analysis, where the researchers identified user requirements, analyzed existing flood management limitations in Barangay 178, and designed the initial system architecture, data flow, and entity-relationship diagrams. Sprint 2 involved the development and testing of sensor nodes and the LoRaWAN data transmission process. During this phase, the researchers configured the LoRa32 microcontroller, integrated sensors such as the A02YYUW ultrasonic, LD2413 radar, BME280 multi-parameter sensor, and WH-SP-RG rain sensor, and verified stable communication between sensor nodes and the LoRa gateway. Sprint 3 focused on backend and database development, which included implementing the Flask API for data handling and designing the MySQL database for data storage, retrieval, and real-time processing. Sprint 4 involved the integration of forecasting algorithms, specifically Auto-ARIMA and LightGBM, along with Bayesian Fusion for data reliability enhancement. This sprint aimed to ensure accurate and adaptive flood-level prediction. Finally, Sprint 5 covered the development of the frontend interfaces, which included the Flutter-based admin web dashboard for barangay personnel and the mobile dashboard for residents. This sprint also involved the implementation of alert notifications, automated siren mechanisms, and the integration of all system modules into a unified and functional platform. At the end of each sprint, a review and retrospective were conducted to evaluate progress, resolve encountered issues, and plan necessary improvements.

Through the implementation of the Agile Scrum methodology, the development process of the Real-Time Flood Monitoring System with Water Level Forecasting Using LoRaWAN-Based Wireless Sensor Network became systematic, adaptive, and collaborative. The iterative nature of Scrum ensured that each phase resulted in a tangible and testable output, allowing continuous validation of the system’s performance and reliability. This methodology not only enhanced the efficiency of the development process but also ensured that the final system met its objectives of providing accurate, real-time flood monitoring and forecasting for improved disaster preparedness in the community.
